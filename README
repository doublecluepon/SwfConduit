An event-driven, bidirectional Flash socket server written in Python using 
Twisted and PyAMF. 

SwfConduit allows you to asynchronously communicate between the server and 
clients by passing event objects over a bidirectional AMF3 socket. SwfConduit 
uses full objects, so no messing around with serialization on either client
or server, it all happens automatically!

SwfConduit will be powering Emerald Kingdom, an MMORPG written in AS3,
and StoryTeller, the Emerald Kingdom world builder.

This is a preview release. It works, but there is little polish and only 
the bare minimum of features are implemented.

SwfConduit Requirements:

1) Python 2.6
2) Twisted
3) PyAMF 0.6 (available from http://pyamf.org)

Client Requirements:

1) AMF3
         - AMF0 does not support full object serialization
2) Flash clients require AS3
         - AS1/2 do not support raw binary sockets

Planned features for the 1.0 development cycle

    *) Automated unit testing
    *) Autogenerate the socket-policy.xml file
    *) Encryption
    *) Set of plugins for common tasks such as ORM, Users, and Chat
    *) More documentation and examples on how to write clients

Planned features for future releases

    *) UDP support
            Speed at the cost of reliability
    *) Inter-server communications
    *) Server clusters
            Sessions are opened on unburneded server
            Sessions can be moved from server to server to balance load and create a 
            single world

To run SwfConduit:

    twistd -ny swfconduit.tac

To build modules for SwfConduit, look at 

    1) swfconduit.server
        A server. Each application should have one
    2) swfconduit.session
        Keeps track of session state. Extend to add more tracking
    3) swfconduit.event
        A message to/from client/server. Each type of message needs an Event class

Be sure to edit the socket-policy.xml file for each server you add.
